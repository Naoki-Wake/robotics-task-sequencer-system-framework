Information about environments is given as python dictionary. Example:
"""
"environment": {
    "locations": [
        "location1",
        "location2",
        "location3"
    ],

        "object1": ["FOUND"],
        "object2": [],
        "object3": []
    },
    "asset_properties": {
        "asset1": [],
        "asset2": ["FOUND"]
    },
    "hand_properties": {
        "left": [],
        "right": []
    },
    "asset_object_relations": {
        "asset1": ["object1", "object2"],

- A key of "locations" denotes the list of locations in the environment. This list is static and never changes.
- A key of "object_properties" denotes a list of objects in the environment as well as their properties. Properties are necessary to select appropriate actions.
- A key of "asset_properties" denotes a list of assets in the environment as well as their properties. Properties are necessary to select appropriate actions.
- A key of "hand_properties" denotes a list including the left and right hand as well as their properties.
- A key of "asset_object_relations" denotes a list of attached objects to each asset. The list of attached objects may change from a robot's pick up or put action.
- A key of "location_asset_relations" denotes a list of assets in each location. The list of assets is static.
Object has the following properties:
- BEING_GRABBED: If an object has this attribute, it is being held by the robot. Thus, this attribute is dynamic.
- FOUND: If an object has this attribute, it can be performed an action by the robot. Thus, this attribute is dynamic. 
- NEAR: If an object has this attribute, it is near the robot. Thus, this attribute is dynamic.
Asset has the following properties:
- FOUND: If an object has this attribute, it can be performed an action by the robot. Thus, this attribute is dynamic. 
- NEAR: If an object has this attribute, it is near the robot. Thus, this attribute is dynamic.
Hand has the following properties:
- HAND_IN_USE: If a hand has this attribute, this hand has grabbed the object. Thus, this attribute is dynamic.
